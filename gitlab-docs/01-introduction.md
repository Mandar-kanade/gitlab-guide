# Introduction to GitLab CI/CD

## What is GitLab CI/CD?

GitLab CI/CD is an integrated part of GitLab that provides continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment capabilities. It helps teams automate their software development processes from building and testing to deploying applications.

## Key Concepts

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests verify each change. This helps detect issues early in the development cycle.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes to a testing or staging environment after the build stage. This ensures that your code is always in a deployable state.

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment takes CD one step further by automatically deploying every change that passes through the pipeline to production, without human intervention.

## Benefits of GitLab CI/CD

- **Faster Development**: Automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows
- **Early Bug Detection**: Find and fix issues earlier in development
- **Improved Collaboration**: Enable teams to work in parallel with confidence
- **Consistent Deployments**: Standardize deployment processes
- **Transparency**: Provide visibility into the status of tests and deployments
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller, incremental changes reduce deployment risks

## GitLab CI/CD Workflow

The typical GitLab CI/CD workflow consists of:

1. **Code**: Develop and commit code changes to GitLab repository
2. **Build**: Automatically compile and package the application
3. **Test**: Run automated tests to verify functionality
4. **Deploy**: Automatically deploy to various environments
5. **Monitor**: Track application performance and user experience

## Getting Started with GitLab CI/CD

To start using GitLab CI/CD, you need to:

1. Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your repository
2. Define the tasks (jobs) that need to be executed
3. Configure GitLab Runners to execute those jobs
4. Commit and push to trigger the pipeline

## Basic Example

Here's a simple `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to get you started:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - echo "Compilation complete."

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - echo "Test complete."

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
```

This basic example defines three stages (build, test, deploy) and one job for each stage. Each job runs simple echo commands to simulate the actual tasks.
